  - Secure authentication using hashed passwords (e.g., bcrypt).
  - Endpoints for user registration, login, and session management.

- **Database**
  - MongoDB for persistent and scalable data storage.
  - User data stored with proper schema validation.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
